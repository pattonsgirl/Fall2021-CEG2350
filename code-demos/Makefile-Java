# This is an example of a Makefile for Java in Linux
#       I recommend to compare this to the Makefile-C example given
#               since it has more thorough comments

# define java compiler & java program
#   Note: it would be better to do an absolute path to javac & java
JCC = javac
JV = java

# define compilation flag(s)
#   -g compiles with debugging information
JFLAGS = -g

# default action of my makefile (because this is first)
#       pre-req is that demo.java exists
default: demo.java
        $(JCC) $(JFLAGS) demo.java

# defining target (or command to be used with make) to run my program
execute:
        $(JV) demo

# defining target to delete my compiled program
delete:
        rm demo.class
