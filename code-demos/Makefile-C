# This is an example of a Makefile for C in Windows
#   That means paths and commands are configured for WINDOWS, NOT LINUX
#		Didn't think I'd make it that easy, did you ;)

#PROGNAME is a variable that need to be changed to the name of your
#	program.  So if I have a code file named code.c
#	the PROGNAME variable needs to be code.c
#	The rest of this "script" will plug the variable in appropriately
#	To reference your code file
PROGNAME = code.c

#EXENAME is the name of the executable file to run your code
EXENAME = program.exe

#This creates an executable file using the GCC compiler for Windows
#  This is the default action that will happen if only `make` is entered
#  PROGNAME (code.c) is listed as a pre requisite for this action to happen
$(EXENAME): $(PROGNAME)
	#Using gcc options to specify output program name & print all warnings
	c:/MinGW/bin/gcc -Wall -o $EXENAME $PROGNAME

#run uses Windows cmd syntax to run the compiled program.
run: $(EXENAME)
	.\$(EXENAME)

#clean uses Windows cmd syntax to delete the compiled program
clean:
	del /Q $(EXENAME)
